Learn IDE opened with the new line of the console as partially hidden, had to resize it or pop it out to fix it. Annoying.
Also earlier Learn IDE installed without asking me where to install it. I don't want things on C:. I don't like this trend of programs thinking they can just install themselves on C:.

why is there a heart in the terminal
is terminal != console
typing "console" doesn't give anything.

why is README.md a markdown file when it's HTML
oh i see, typora can read html. some of it shows up. something about markdown not being truly standardized.

the "learn" command/test here checks whether "edit-me.txt" is empty, not whether or not the file has actually been edited. the test is presumably the "first_ide_lab_spec.rb" file. "rb" presumably means Ruby. there is no "learn" in that file. unclear where "learn" is going to call that file, or if that file is executing. i suppose i could remove it and see if "learn" still functions. seems like it only changes what shows up in the terminal though.
  > "When you run learn, you will also see that the Learn website is aware of the status of your lab represented by the "Lights" on the right." i see.
